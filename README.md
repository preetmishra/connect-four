A simple connect four game written in JavaScript.

#### About
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
The _objective_ of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
